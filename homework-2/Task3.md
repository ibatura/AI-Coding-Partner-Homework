## 📋 Project Overview
    Build a customer support ticket management system that imports tickets from multiple file formats, automatically categorizes issues, and assigns priorities.
### Task 3: Test Suite
    Generate comprehensive tests achieving >85% code coverage.

Required Test Files:

tests/
├── test_ticket_api          # API endpoints (11 tests)
├── test_ticket_model        # Data validation (9 tests)
├── test_import_csv          # CSV parsing (6 tests)
├── test_import_json         # JSON parsing (5 tests)
├── test_import_xml          # XML parsing (5 tests)

Test Coverage Requirements:


### Requirements:
    Create separate branch for coding
    Overall test coverage >85%    
    Run test and provide evidence of coverage

### Constraints:
    No test are needed for this task
    No documentation is needed for this task
    Create only short document how-to-run md formated file
    Use as **Tech Stack:** Python Flask
    Use as a home folder: homework-2
    Use best practices for code organization
    Comment your code
    Create a high level plan first and save it in a file with md format
    Create merge request to homework-2-submission branch in this repository
